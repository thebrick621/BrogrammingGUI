      <rich_text># This is our player. The main playable user in the game. Will have custom name that is defined on Save file creation.
# You wake up @ your computer desk and without realizing fell asleep with your new Digi-Real Mixed Reality headset on...again.
# Even though you just bought the headset you have descended into the digital world, finding the combonation of computer graphics and reality to be the
# most appealing thing you can do with your otherwise boring life. This is the first time you've fallen asleep with the headset on though. 
# Unbeknownst to you, or the general public, Zark McMuckies the company's founder and CEO has programmed these headsets to trap its users in this
# new altered reality that he has full control of. You awake missing almost all your memories, starting as User 0 in McMuckies' master plan, or so you think.
# This reality is fully controlled by McMuckies and as a part of the new zombie_user protocol all memories are selectively altered. In reality, you have been
# living as the one of the last people in base reality, refusing to adopt this new parasytic technology. You are a part of a squad of ethical hackers, the 
# Brogramming team. Over the course of your journey you slowly realize through carefully placed clues from the rest of the Brogramming squad in base
# reality who you are and what your purpose in McMuckies' game is. The ultimate goal, take down McMuckies' servers and realease the rest of the world
# from this altered reality controlled by an evil half-lizard mechanical ‘man’.

Base Health: 50; can be raised via special stat altering items or slowly through leveling up.
